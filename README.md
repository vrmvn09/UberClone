# UberClone

UberClone is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that mimics the functionality of the Uber ride-hailing app. It allows users to select a ride type, view trip information, and confirm a ride. This project demonstrates the use of SwiftUI, data binding, environment objects, and custom view components.

## Features

- **Trip Information View**: Displays the current location, pickup time, selected destination, and drop-off time.
- **Ride Type Selection**: Allows users to choose from different ride types (e.g., UberX, UberXL) with dynamic pricing.
- **Payment Option View**: Shows the selected payment method and card details.
- **Ride Confirmation**: Provides a button to confirm the ride request.
